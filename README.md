# 2D.TileMap

What this is:
	
	This is going to be a simple 2D Tile Map and related code, I am just trying this just for fun and practice. Its more just a collection of tools, and ideas. Includes a Level Editor, basic game using the maps written in C++17, and some tools written in Rust and a  map viewier. Take this project with a grain of salt.
