# 2D TileMap Overview:

This project is designed as a straightforward 2D Tile Map level file format, along with accompanying code, embarked upon for both enjoyment and skill enhancement. It essentially serves as an amalgamation of tools and concepts. The project encompasses a Level Editor, a rudimentary game leveraging the maps crafted in C++17, alongside some tools developed in Rust, and a map viewer. It's advisable to approach this project with a casual perspective.

Project Components:

Editor: A level editor developed using Qt6, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) and the capability to export levels in either binary or text file formats.

Test-Game: A basic game that demonstrates the use of the Level file format.

GFX-CMP: A tool for merging resources.

Convert: A command-line utility for converting level files between binary and text formats.

rs/: A directory hosting a Rust-based example implementation of the level file format.
