# 2D.TileMap

What this is:
	
This is going to be a simple 2D Tile Map and related code, I am just trying this just for fun and practice.
It is more just a collection of tools, and ideas. Includes a Level Editor, basic game using the maps written 
in C++17, and some tools written in Rust and a  map viewier. Take this project with a grain of salt.

components of this project:

editor - Level editor written in Qt6. Contains GUI and ability to save to binary or text level file formats.


test-game - a Example implementation of a simple game using the Level file format


gfx-cmp -  resource concatination tool


convert - command line tool to convert between binary and text level file foramts


rs/ folder contains a example Rust implemenatation of the file format
